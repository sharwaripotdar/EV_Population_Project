# EV_Population_Project
Data Visualization Project utilizing PowerBI and Tableau

The Electric Vehicle Population Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the distribution, trends, and characteristics of electric vehicles (EVs) 
using a dataset from the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). 

The project provides insights into EVs' types, growth, and electric range, particularly Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

# Project Overview
**Objective:**  Examine the trends and dynamics of electric vehicle adoption, emphasizing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), through comprehensive analysis of the Washington State Department of Licensing dataset.

**Tools:** 

Excel - For data cleaning

PowerBI and Tableau - For interactive visualizations

**Dataset:** The project utilizes the Electric Vehicle dataset provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL), including information on VIN, County, City, Model Year, Electric Vehicle Type, Electric Range, Base MSRP, Legislative District, and more.

# Results and Interpretation

1) **Distribution Analysis:** The analysis reveals that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) constitute a dominant 70% of the electric vehicle population, indicating a strong preference for fully electric propulsion.

2) **Average Electric Range:** BEVs generally offer longer electric ranges, appealing to consumers seeking extended driving distances solely on electric power.

3) **Range and Alternative Fuel Correlation:** The absence of correlation suggests that electric range and alternative fuel status may be independent factors influencing consumer choices.

4) **Geographic Distribution:** Geographic distribution highlights potential charging infrastructure gaps in rural regions, suggesting areas for targeted development.

5) **Price Distribution:** The average Base MSRP for BEVs varies between manufacturers, with FISKER Motors having the most affordable options.
